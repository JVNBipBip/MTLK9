They spend the day with us — training sessions broken into short bursts, real-world practice in parks and streets, rest periods, and socialization when appropriate. We bring them back in the afternoon. You get a brief update and homework for the evening.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where does training happen?",
    a: "In the real world — sidewalks, parks, quiet streets, sometimes our facility. We don't train in a sterile room. Your dog learns where life happens, so skills transfer to your daily routine. Locations vary based on your dog's needs and our schedule.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my dog bond more with the trainer than me?",
    a: "No. Dogs form different relationships with different people. Your bond with your dog is built on living together, not just training. We're the practice coach; you're the one they go home to. Owner handoff sessions ensure you learn the skills and maintain the connection.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do skills transfer to me?",
    a: "We include dedicated owner handoff sessions where we teach you exactly what we've been working on. You practice with us, get feedback, and leave with clear homework. Day training accelerates your dog's learning; handoff sessions ensure you can maintain and build on it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is day training right for puppies?",
    a: "Yes, with some considerations. Puppies have shorter attention spans and need more rest. We adapt the schedule — shorter sessions, more naps, age-appropriate socialization. The Puppy Complete package is often a better fit for very young puppies; day training works well from 4–5 months up.",

                  Charlie&apos;s owner worked 9–5 and couldn&apos;t do weekday sessions. Charlie had endless 
                  energy and zero impulse control. After 4 weeks of day training, he was walking calmly on 
                  leash, settling on cue, and responding reliably to recall. The owner handoff sessions 
                  taught his owner how to maintain everything — and Charlie&apos;s bond with his owner only 
                  got stronger. His owner says it was the best investment they could have made.
